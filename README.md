# Quizzical

This was a fun challenge! ðŸŽ‰
I made Quizzical with **React and the Open Trivia API**. I designed the interface, and decided to add a few extra features like **dark mode**, and an **animated background made with SVG Icons and CSS**. I found it to be nice to add the **customization features** for the quiz (such as number of questions and category), and lastly, I added **visual feedback** for the user when they check the answers, load the page, encounter error, etc.

If you do well in the quiz, you can get some nice **Confetti!**

This is an open-ended Scrimba challenge.

## Overview

I used **OpenTrivia API** to get random questions, and built the web app with **React.js**

I also used the following libraries:

**Visual Libraries**

-   Ui Ball Loaders for the loading state,
-   React DOM Confetti for the win state feedback,
-   Phosphor Icons for the background and other icons.

**Other Libraries**

-   Modern CSS Reset
-   Nanoid for the unique id generation.
